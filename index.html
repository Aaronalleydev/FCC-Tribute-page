    <h2>All about big Ted</h2>
    <p>Hastings became a police officer in 1982, and received his training at the RUC Training Depot in Enniskillen, Garnerville Police College in Belfast and the Gough Barracks in Armagh.</p>

<p>Serving with the Royal Ulster Constabulary during The Troubles, he was subjected to discrimination based on his Catholic faith. This included a pipe bomb explosion which resulted in him getting severely injured and his best friend PC Patrick O'Malley (also a Catholic) being killed, which was subsequently covered up. After recovering from his injuries, he moved to The City in the West Midlands on promotion to Sergeant and joined Central Police in 1989. Hastings is an Authorised Firearms Officer, presumably from being routinely armed whilst working in Northern Ireland.</p>    

<p>His first posting with Central Police was Dorden Station, later moving on to Millbarrow Station. After becoming an Inspector in 1995 he was assigned to Greencastle Station and later Wyvernridge Station in 1999. In 2001 he was assigned to Professional Standards based in Pelbury House as a detective. Upon further promotion to Chief Inspector in 2005, he was assigned back to Dorden Station, and later Northby Station as a Deputy Divisional Commander, before being transferred back to Professional Standards at Pelbury House. In 2009 he was promoted to Superintendent, and put in charge of AC-12, operating out of the separate AC-12 Building.</p>

<p>Hastings has been awarded the Queen's Golden Jubilee Medal, The Queens Diamond Jubilee Medal, and the Police Long Service and Good Conduct Medal. </p>
